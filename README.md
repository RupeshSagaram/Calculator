# Calculator

Made a calculator from stratch, the following steps were taken to finish this project:
- added math functions and linked it to buttons using addEventListeners.
-added additional buttons such as dot, backspace and added keyboard support.
- In css, added multiple divs and used flex to wrap the content.

lessons learnt: 
- understood how to approach a problem by breaking it down into small parts and come up logic before trying to write code.
-learnt lot of new syntax by googling things and also used flags in javascript to capture and call functions for the clicks.
